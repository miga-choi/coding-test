# 69. Sqrt(x)

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be **_non-negative_** as well.

You **_must not use_** any built-in exponent function or operator.

- For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in c++ or `x ** 0.5` in python.

## Example 1:

```java
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
```

## Example 2:

```java
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
```

## Constraints:

- `0 <= x <= 2³¹ - 1`
