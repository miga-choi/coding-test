# 326. Power of Three

Given an integer `n`, return _`true` if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return `false`_.

An integer `n` is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that `n == 3ˣ`.

## Example 1:

```
Input: n = 27
Output: true
Explanation: 27 = 3³
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: n = 0
Output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3ˣ = 0.
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: n = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3ˣ = (-1).
```

## Constraints:

- -2³¹<= n <= 2³¹ - 1
