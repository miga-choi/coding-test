# 145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the postorder traversal of its nodes' values_.

## Example 1:

![Alt text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/pre1.jpg)

```java
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1]
```

## Example 2:

```java
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

## Example 3:

```java
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

## Constraints:

- The number of the nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
