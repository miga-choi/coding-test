# 392. Is Subsequence

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_ `s` _is a **subsequence** of_ `t`, or `false` _otherwise_.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

## Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

## Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length <= 100`
- `0 <= t.length <= 10⁴`
- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up**: Suppose there are lots of incoming `s`, say `s₁, s₂, ..., s𝑘` where `𝑘 >= 10⁹`, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?
