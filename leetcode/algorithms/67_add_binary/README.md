# 67. Add Binary

Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return **_their sum as a binary string_**.

## Example 1:

```java
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```

## Example 2:

```java
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10⁴`
- `a` and `b` consist only of `'0'` or `'1'` characters.
- Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
