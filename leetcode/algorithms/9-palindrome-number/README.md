# 9. Palindrome Number

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a
**_palindrome_**
, and `false` otherwise.

## Example 1:

```javascript
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

## Example 2:

```javascript
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

## Example 3:

```javascript
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

```

## Constraints:

- `-2³¹ <= x <= 2³¹ - 1`
