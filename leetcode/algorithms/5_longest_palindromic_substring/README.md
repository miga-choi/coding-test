# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

Given a string `s`, return _the longest **palindromic substring**_ in `s`.

**Palindromic**: A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.

**Substring**: A **substring** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of characters within a string.

## Example 1:

```
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s = "cbbd";
Output: "bb";
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consist of only digits and English letters.
