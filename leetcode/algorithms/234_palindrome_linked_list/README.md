# 234. Palindrome Linked List

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return `true` _if it is a [palindrome](## "A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward.") or_ `false` _otherwise_.

## Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10‚Åµ]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`

**Follow up:** Could you do it in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space?
