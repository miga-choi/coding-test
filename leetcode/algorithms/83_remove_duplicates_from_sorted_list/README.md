# 83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return _the linked list **sorted** as well._

## Example 1:

![Alt text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/list1.jpg)

```java
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

## Example 2:

![Alt text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/list2.jpg)

```java
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be **sorted** in ascending order.
